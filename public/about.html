<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a fun loving person. I love to go places and see new and exciting things. For me, exploration is more of a journey than a destination.</p>

<p>I have a beautiful wife and two lovely boys. We are one happy family. We are simple and take life one step at a time. We school diligently, we work tirelessly, and we play hard. We are committed to using our lives in the service of something greater than ourselves. We are the NEROS!</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
