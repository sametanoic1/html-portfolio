<h1>The Best Movies According to Sammy</h1>
<h2>My top three (3) movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>I totally love epic movies. The scene and word play in this movie is indeed mindblowing. This movie shows that the decisions we make daily no matter how small can have far reaching consequences on us and others.</p>
<h3>The Man in the Iron Mask</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it is all about friendship, betrayal, loyalty, and the quest to render service to something greater than ourselves.</p>
<h3>Young Sheldon</h3>
<p>The witty and intelligent mind of the young man is amazing. This movie is both hilarious and educational</p>
